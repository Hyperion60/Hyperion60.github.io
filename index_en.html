								<p>The game Dith takes place in a post-apocalyptic world during the "Theldark" era, where humans became very dependent on robots. However the energy used for robots is progressively decreasing involving their dysfunction in the whole world. A scientist, the "Doctors", discovers an energy source : "the Hyperion". This energy is able to feed again robots ! Too old to move, the scientist transmits his mind in a cube containing the Hyperion, the DITH.
								   The player will have to lead the DITH through different world until the power station "Ivanof" in order to save the world.</p>

								<p>Ivan, "Ivanof": </p>
								<blockquote>During my childhood, I was interesting in computers only for online games. 
								But as I grew up, I started to wonder how the computer I use is working. Then I searched 
								information about the digital world through Youtube videos.
                                            Knowing the international geopolitic situation, I want to study in the cyber-security field during my 
                                            course in EPITA. I'm not a gamer, so this project will help me to learn new things about video games creation.
                                            When I was young, I generally liked creating. So I liked to draw or games as "Kapla" and "Lego".
                                            My first meet with programming was with "Mindstorm", a Lego robot. During my adolescence, I was interested in photography for the artistic and technological sides, but this field was not enough related
                                            with computing. Later I discovered drones, for the top range we can have hight quality camera and high flight quality.
					On computing side, I began to be interested on computer set up. But I did not have the knowledge to understand the exchange between components. I began researches on cybersecurity when newspapers talked about attacks on data servers.
									Further, I subscribed to Youtube channels as "O1net tv" and "Nowtech", those channels helped me to open my mind on several subfields of the digital world.</blockquote>
								<hr />
								<p>Rémi, "Hyperion": </p>
								<blockquote>Since the 2nd, I became interested, then I became passionate about IT. Firstly for the hardware part, then for
                                            the network part and finally for the code. In the project made in ISN, we had to code the network part
                                            between a server and a client in Python, I liked this part. So I became passionate by this field and then the idea of making my course at Epita came to me. Another point which encouraged me in the computing field
                                            : my parents were not fan of my passion for explosives and dangerous chemistry. Video games came in
                                            my life later, at the end of my 2nd.</blockquote>
								<hr />
								<p>Simon, "Doctors": </p>
								<blockquote>I started to play video games 10 years ago and started to look closer my computer 5 years ago.
I have always been impressed by all these little components which allow me to play on Internet.
After having understood basis of IT in the college, I wanted to make of this hobby my job. Today I am completely in my world. I decided at the beginning of this year to go with my current friend. It was easier as we had already talked about the project.
The more days passed and more it was clear, this project allowed me to discover more on graphics, programming and artificial intelligences.</blockquote>
